Hello people. im M3ko a 16y old furry from Brazil, i have begun programming in mid 2023 and in early 2024 started to learn web development and python. I hope to some day be able to also learn C# but die to the way things are going it's probably gonna take some time.
I have also taken an interest in cyber security and hacking lately and might go that route professionaly if i can
